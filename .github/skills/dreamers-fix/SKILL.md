$ARGUMENTS

If no bug description was provided, halt + ask.

## Todo - Before you begin.
- Declare a todo list marking all steps at entry: Step 1 / Step 2 / Step 3.

## Step 1 — Branch setup
- Per `git-workflow` (Kernel): fetch + checkout default + pull + cut `fix/<slug>`.

## Step 2 — Scope survey + escalation
- Read the bug surface (files identified from the description).
- In bug-fix scope (single file or tight cluster, no architectural change) → continue.
- Scope blowup (multiple unrelated subsystems, needs new module, schema change, etc.) → halt + recommend `/dreamers-full <bug description>` instead.

## Step 3 — Regression test + implement + run
- Write a failing test that captures the buggy behavior. If no test infra exists for the affected surface, note the absence.
- Implement the fix per `comment-rules` + `testing-mandate` (Kernel). Edit only files in the bug-fix surface from Step 2. Stage with `git add`.
- Type-check + run tests. Fix inline (max 3 attempts) then halt.

## Exit
- Bug-fix surface, regression test name, test status. Next step: `/dreamers-review --lens sentinel` for a quick audit, then commit + `/dreamers-pr` to ship.

## Subagent allowlist (HARD RULE)

Do not use any non-Dreamers agent unless explicitly authorized by user.

## Subagent prompt — required content

Every `task()` invocation MUST include in the prompt:
- **Context** — what this agent is being asked to do and why
- **Prior work** — what was done previously, with absolute paths to any output files
- **What is needed** — specific deliverable
- **Constraints** — hard rules the agent must not violate
- **Definition of Done** — how to know the work is complete
- **Plan file path** — absolute path to the relevant plan file (if applicable)
- **Mandatory line:** `Do NOT call manage_todo_list. The skill that invoked you owns its todo.`

All `task()` calls use `mode: "sync"` — the call blocks until the agent returns.

## Implementation discipline

- **Plan adherence:** edit only files in the plan's scope. No while-I'm-here cleanup, no unrelated refactors mixed with feature work.
- **No spec-arguing comments:** never add a code comment that argues the spec permits a pattern.
- **Branch identity check:** before the first edit, `git log --oneline -3`. Confirm the branch and recent commits match the expected feature. If not, halt and surface.
- **No dependency installs without permission.** Don't run `npm install`, `pip install`, etc. without explicit user approval.
- **Type-check before declaring implementation done.** Run the project's type-check command from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and fix errors before moving on.

# Git Workflow (mandatory)

Every milestone uses a feature branch + PR — never work directly on the default branch.

## Startup verification (do this FIRST)
1. Detect the repo's default branch:
   ```bash
   DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')
   [ -z "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" ] && DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name 2>/dev/null || echo "main")
   ```
   Store `$DEFAULT_BRANCH` — use it everywhere `main` would have been used.
2. `git fetch origin && git log origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH --oneline -5` — anchor to remote truth before reading any `.dreamers/` files. Workspace files are local-only and may be stale. `origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH` is the authoritative record of what is actually shipped.

## Branch setup (before invoking `/dreamers-implement`)
1. `git checkout $DEFAULT_BRANCH && git pull origin $DEFAULT_BRANCH` — never build off a stale local default branch.
2. Cut `feat/<slug>` from `$DEFAULT_BRANCH`.
3. Confirm `.dreamers/` is in the project's `.gitignore`. If not, add it before any further edits.
4. No init commit — the first commit for the milestone is the first thing in the PR diff.

## Commit discipline (non-negotiable)
1. **Commit at end of each cycle** — one commit per plan in the sequence (single-plan: one commit total; multi-plan: N commits, one per plan).
2. **Commit before PR creation** — a final commit capturing any last changes before opening the PR.
3. **No auto-commit after PR is created** — if changes are made after `gh pr create`, do NOT commit automatically. Ask the user first.

## Push discipline (non-negotiable)
`git push` happens EXACTLY ONCE — immediately before `gh pr create` at final close-out. Never push after intermediate commits, between cycles, or at any other point in the pipeline.

## Post-PR push discipline
If the user approves a post-PR commit, push with `git push` (no force). The PR will update automatically.

## Commit structure (one commit per cycle)
- Exactly **one** commit per plan/cycle, immediately after the reviewer findings have been applied and tests are green (and user testing, if required, is signed off).
- The orchestrator stages changes with `git add` throughout the cycle but does **not** run `git commit` until the cycle ends.
- Commit message format follows `.github/instructions/git.instructions.md` (if present). Pipeline-specific bits:
  - Subject: `feat: <plan-name>` (or `feat!: <plan-name>` for breaking changes — see git.instructions.md for the breaking-change footer rule)

One commit per plan keeps each plan's contribution atomic. Reviewer-fix application is part of the same cycle (not separate commits).

## What gets committed
Nothing in `.dreamers/` is committed — all workspace files (plans, retros, improvements.md) are gitignored and stay local. Ensure `.dreamers/` is in the project's `.gitignore`.

## No worktrees
The orchestrator works directly on the feature branch. Unless explicitly requested by the user.

# Testing Coverage Mandate (MANDATORY)

Every plan must express its test coverage intent through the Acceptance Criteria's Layer annotations. The planner specifies *what observable outcome* the AC requires and *which test layer* covers it. The implementer (orchestrator at `/dreamers-implement` Step 1) writes the actual tests from each AC's Given/When/Then.

## How test coverage is expressed in plans (new format)

Plan ACs are numbered Given/When/Then statements with a Layer annotation per AC. See `plan-writing-guide.md` § "Acceptance Criteria format" for the canonical spec.

```
<acceptance_criteria>
1. Given <state>, when <trigger>, then <observable outcome>.
   *Layer: unit.*
2. Given <state>, when <trigger>, then <observable outcome>.
   *Layer: integration.*
3. Given <state>, when <trigger>, then <observable outcome>.
   *Layer: E2E.*
</acceptance_criteria>
```

Layer label set (closed): `unit` / `integration` / `E2E` / `perf`. Compound labels allowed when one assertion serves two purposes (e.g., `*Layer: integration / perf.*`).

**Test coverage intent is expressed via the `*Layer: ...*` annotation on each Acceptance Criterion — not via a standalone Test Cases section.** Do not write a separate Test Cases section in a plan; embed the test layer directly in the AC. This keeps ACs and test specification in one place so they never drift.

## Coverage requirement (every plan)

Across all of a plan's ACs, the layer mix must cover the following whenever applicable to the work — think through each layer explicitly:

**Unit layer**
- Each significant function, method, or class in isolation.
- All branches: happy path, edge cases (boundary values, empty/null/max), negative cases (invalid input, error states).
- Any pure logic that does not require a real device, network, or database.

**Integration layer**
- Interactions between layers: repository ↔ data source, ViewModel ↔ repository, service ↔ external API.
- Database reads/writes (real or in-memory, not mocked).
- Auth flows end-to-end within the backend.
- Cloud function triggers and side-effects.

**UI / E2E layer**
- Full user journeys through the UI: screen load → interaction → outcome visible on screen.
- Navigation flows between screens.
- Error and empty states rendered correctly in the UI.
- Any flow that requires a real device or emulator.
- **Navigation change rule (mandatory):** When a plan changes how a nav element behaves (tab tap, modal open, screen transition), the plan must include at least one AC with `*Layer: E2E.*` — not just unit/integration. Probe enforces this in the layer audit and blocks if missing.

**Regression risks**
- Anything touching existing behavior that could break — call out the specific existing test or flow at risk in the plan's Context section.

If a layer cannot be covered automatically (e.g., camera permission flows), flag it explicitly as a manual-verification requirement in the plan's Verification section with a reason.

## Probe's layer audit (consumes the new format)

In `/dreamers-implement` Step 4 (coverage sweep) and Step 5 (parallel review with Probe), the layer audit reads each AC's `*Layer: ...*` annotation to verify coverage at each layer was implemented. Probe blocks the cycle if any AC's annotated layer lacks a corresponding green test.

## Test benchmarks

Each project that uses `/dreamers-implement` maintains a `./test-benchmarks.md` file at the project root. The file records measured run times per test command so the orchestrator can set realistic timeouts.

- **File path:** `./test-benchmarks.md` at the project root (committed to version control).
- **Recommended-timeout formula:** `max(last_run_time × 2, 30s)` — the 2× multiplier accounts for machine variance; 30s is a non-negotiable floor.
- **Orchestrator updates** the row for each test command after every successful test run. **Humans may edit** the `Notes` column to capture CI environment factors or known flakiness.
- Template: `.github/dreamers/templates/test-benchmarks.md` (catalog-relative; resolves to `~/.copilot/dreamers/templates/test-benchmarks.md` at install).

# Comment Rules

## Core principle
Comments must add value that the code cannot express itself. Concise, no fluff, no separators — value only.

## When to comment
- Non-obvious logic: why a non-obvious approach was chosen, constraints, gotchas
- Public API documentation callers need to use the interface correctly
- TODO/FIXME with specific, actionable notes
- License headers

## When NOT to comment
- Code that reads naturally from well-named functions and variables
- Anything that restates what the code obviously does (`const isRunning` does not need `// tracks whether running`)

## Strict prohibitions
- **No plan/ticket references** — never mention plan files, milestone names (D25, plan-3), ticket numbers, or agent names in source code
- **No separator comments** — never use `// ---`, `// ===`, `// ###`, blank-comment lines, or visual dividers
- **No spec rationalization** — never write comments arguing a spec permits a pattern; implement cleanly and let review judge
- **No redundant JSDoc/KDoc** that only repeats the function signature
- **No em dashes. no exceptions**

## Style
- One line when possible; never exceed two lines for inline comments
- Write *why*, never *what*
- If a comment requires more than two lines to be useful, the code needs refactoring, not more words
</comment-rules>
