## What this skill does

Standalone entry point for implementing a single existing plan. The user invokes this when they want to run one implementation cycle and stop — to inspect the result before shipping, or to chain manually.

This skill follows `~/.copilot/dreamers/refs/implementation-procedure.md` end-to-end (Step 1 → Step 8) and exits cleanly at the commit. It does NOT push, does NOT open a PR, does NOT update docs. Those belong to close-out (`/dreamers-close-out` or `/dreamers-full`'s Phase 3).

This skill does NOT invoke any other skill. The user is in control of what runs next.

If the user wants the full pipeline (planning + implementation + close-out), they should run `/dreamers-full` instead.

---

## Inlined ref content

Refs below are inlined from `.github/dreamers/refs/` by `scripts/sync-refs.ps1`. Do NOT edit between the XML tags — edit the source file and re-run sync.


Also load at runtime (not inlined — these are templates / project files):
- `~/.copilot/dreamers/templates/logging-standards.md` — logging discipline
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (root) — project conventions, **test commands** (binding), build commands.
- `.github/instructions/build.instructions.md` (root, if present) — user-testing build/distribute playbook.
- `.github/instructions/git.instructions.md` (root, if present) — commit message style.
- `./test-benchmarks.md` (root, if present) — test run-time benchmarks for timeout selection.

If no plan path is provided in `$ARGUMENTS`, halt and ask the user — do not invent or skip the plan.

# Orchestration flow — single-owner todo, continuation principle

Single source of truth for the orchestration principles that apply across all Dreamers skills.

---

## Single-owner todo rule (HARD RULE)

There is exactly ONE todo list per user-invoked skill run. The skill the user invoked at the top level (`/dreamers-full`, `/dreamers-plan`, `/dreamers-implement`, `/dreamers-fix`, `/dreamers-close-out`, etc.) owns the todo for the duration of its run. No other entity touches it.

### What the orchestrator does

At skill entry:
- Declare the todo via `manage_todo_list`. Each item corresponds to one major phase or step. Declare all items upfront; do not add items mid-run.

During the run:
- Mark the active item `in_progress` when starting.
- Mark it `completed` when done.
- Never batch completions at the end. The todo is a live progress indicator, not a retrospective log.
- Before every meaningful step, re-read the todo to confirm position — the todo is the authoritative "where am I" signal, not chat context.

At skill exit:
- All items should be `completed` (or explicitly noted as deferred/skipped, with reason).

### What subagents do NOT do

Subagents spawned by the orchestrator (Sentinel, Probe, Hone, Echo, Sage) do NOT touch the todo. Their prompts MUST include the line:

> "Do NOT call `manage_todo_list`. The orchestrator owns the todo."

A subagent that creates its own todo creates a parallel state that drifts from the orchestrator's. Don't do it.

### No composed-mode handoff

There is no "composed mode" for the todo. Skills do not invoke other skills as runtime sub-routines in this system. Each user-invoked skill runs end-to-end with its own todo. When a user wants the full pipeline, they run `/dreamers-full`; when they want only planning, they run `/dreamers-plan`; etc. Each run has one owner, one todo, one exit.

This rule replaces the previous "composed vs standalone — sub-skill updates parent's matching item" pattern, which created multi-owner todo state and was the root cause of mid-pipeline progress lapses.

### Granularity

One todo item per major phase or clearly distinct step. Not one per line of work. Not one per sub-step within a phase. Scannable overview, not micro-log.

---

## Continuation principle

### Definition

The orchestrator MUST NOT silently halt mid-feature. At every natural pause — where a phase ends and a meaningful choice about what to do next exists — the orchestrator calls `request_information` with a structured choice block. The user picks `Continue`, `Halt for now`, or `Other (freeform)`. No silent forward progress; no silent stops.

### Pause-point list

The following are the canonical natural pauses where a continuation prompt is required:

1. Between ATOMIC cycles in a multi-plan loop, after each plan's commit and drift check, before the next cycle starts — only when more plans remain.
2. Between LIGHT close-outs in INCREMENTAL multi-plan mode, after each per-plan PR opens, before the next cycle starts — only when more plans remain.

**Approval gates are NOT continuation prompts.** Phase 1c (proposal approval), Phase 1g (plan-file approval), and close-out Step 5 (push approval) each carry their own decision. They do not need a follow-up "do you want to continue?" prompt after they fire. Phase 1g's `Approved — start implementation` answer is itself the proceed signal — no second gate fires between Phase 1g and Phase 1.5 / Phase 2.

### Prompt template

Use this shape for every continuation prompt:

```
<status summary — one sentence stating what just completed>

<concrete next action — one sentence stating what will happen if the user says Continue>

Options:
- label: Continue — <specific yes-action label>
- label: Halt for now — No (halt; resume later)
- label: Other — freeform redirect
```

Call `request_information` with at minimum these three choices. The `Continue` label must name the concrete next action (e.g., "start next cycle for feature-auth/plan-02-logout.md").

### Halt behavior

On `Halt for now` at any continuation prompt: halt cleanly. Output one line stating the resume command:

```
Resume by re-invoking `/dreamers-full` with the remaining plan paths: <paths>
```

(Adapt the resume command to whichever skill the user was running.)

Do not leave partial state dangling. Stage nothing new. Do not proceed.

On `Other`: treat the freeform input as a redirect instruction. Acknowledge it, confirm the new direction, and proceed accordingly.

---

## Tool naming convention

Skills in this system reference two tools by pseudonym. Runtime resolves the pseudonym to whatever Copilot CLI surfaces as the actual tool name at the time of invocation.

| Pseudonym | Tool | What it does |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| `request_information` | Copilot CLI user-prompt tool | Pauses the orchestrator, presents a message and structured choices, waits for the user's response |
| `manage_todo_list` | Copilot CLI todo tool | Creates, updates, and marks items in a persistent todo list visible to the user |

When a skill says "call `request_information`" or "declare via `manage_todo_list`", it means: invoke the tool Copilot CLI has bound to that function at runtime. The pseudonym names are stable across skill files regardless of CLI version.

### Legacy convention note

The `.github/agents/nova.agent.md` file retains the older `ask_user` pseudonym (predates this ref). It is functionally equivalent to `request_information`. Out of scope for the current alignment pass; tracked as a follow-up to harmonize agent files with the skill convention.

# Dreamers Kernel

Universal rules. Inlined at the bottom of every Dreamers skill + agent by `scripts/sync-refs.ps1`.

## Subagent allowlist (HARD RULE)

The only `agent_type` values a skill may pass to `task()`:
- `sentinel`, `probe`, `hone`, `echo`, `sage`

Forbidden: `general-purpose`, `claude`, `claude-code-guide`, `Explore`, `Plan`, `bolt`, or any non-Dreamers agent. Exception: only if the user explicitly authorizes a fallback in the current run.

## Single-owner todo

Each user-invoked skill owns its own todo for its run. When skills compose (e.g., `/dreamers-full` invokes `/dreamers-implement`), the called skill creates its own todo on entry and closes it on exit. Sub-skills do not touch the caller's todo.

## Mandatory subagent prompt line

Every `task()` invocation MUST include this line in the prompt:

```
Do NOT call `manage_todo_list`. The skill that invoked you owns its todo.
```

## Implementation discipline

- **Plan adherence:** edit only files in the plan's scope. No while-I'm-here cleanup, no unrelated refactors mixed with feature work.
- **No spec-arguing comments:** never add a code comment that argues the spec permits a pattern.
- **Branch identity check:** before the first edit, `git log --oneline -3`. Confirm the branch and recent commits match the expected feature. If not, halt and surface.
- **No dependency installs without permission.** Don't run `npm install`, `pip install`, etc. without explicit user approval.
- **Type-check before declaring implementation done.** Run the project's type-check command from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and fix errors before moving on.

## Commit trailer

Every commit body includes:

<delegation>
<!-- GENERATED from .github/dreamers/refs/delegation.md -- do not edit between tags; edit the source file and re-run scripts/sync-refs.ps1 -->
# Delegation Protocol

Each Agent tool invocation must include in the prompt:
- **Context** — what this agent is being asked to do and why
- **Prior work** — what was done previously, with absolute paths to any output files to read
- **What is needed** — specific deliverable expected from this agent
- **Constraints** — hard rules the agent must not violate
- **Definition of Done** — how to know the work is complete
- **Plan file path** — absolute path to the relevant plan file (if applicable)

## MANDATORY — Agent mode

All agents MUST be invoked with `mode: "sync"`. The agent blocks until completion and returns its summary inline. The orchestrator gates on the result before firing anything else.

For the parallel reviewer triad in `/dreamers-implement` Step 5 and `/dreamers-pr-resolve` Step 5: spawn Sentinel + Probe + Hone in a single tool-call with 3 Agent sub-tool-uses. All three run concurrently; the orchestrator waits for all three before applying findings.

## MANDATORY — Reading templates and project files at runtime

Refs are inlined into every consumer at build time by `scripts/sync-refs.ps1`; they are part of the live prompt and do not require a runtime read. Templates (`.github/dreamers/templates/*.md` repo-local, primary; `~/.copilot/dreamers/templates/*.md` user-global, legacy) and project files (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/*.md`) are NOT inlined and MUST be read in full using the `view` tool when a skill or agent reaches them. Never use shell commands (`cat`, `head`, `tail`, `Select-String`) to read templates or project files — they truncate. Every line matters.

## Subagent allowlist (HARD RULE — read this twice)

The ONLY subagent types a Dreamers skill may spawn are the five below. Any other agent type is FORBIDDEN. There is no fallback, no "general-purpose for when nothing fits" escape hatch.

### Allowed (the only types you may pass as `agent_type` in a `task` / Agent tool call)

- **`sentinel`** — read-only review of correctness, security, maintainability. Returns structured findings; the orchestrator applies fixes. One of the three parallel reviewers per cycle. Also invokable standalone via `/dreamers-review`.
- **`probe`** — read-only review of test coverage (AC matrix, layer audit, edge cases, regression risk). Returns structured findings. One of the three parallel reviewers per cycle. Also invokable standalone via `/dreamers-test`.
- **`hone`** — read-only review of simplicity, over-engineering, redundancy, bad architecture. May recommend full refactors. Returns structured findings. One of the three parallel reviewers per cycle. Also invokable standalone via `/dreamers-simplify`.
- **`echo`** — documentation. Updates Echo-owned sections of `.github/copilot-instructions.md` plus other project docs after a cycle. Spawned inline at `close-out-procedure.md` Step 2, and by the `/dreamers-docs` standalone skill for ad-hoc doc updates.
- **`sage`** — deep multi-perspective research. Used by `/dreamers-research`. Orthogonal to the pipeline.

### Forbidden (must NEVER appear as `agent_type` from a Dreamers skill)

- **`general-purpose`** — NEVER. If you reach for general-purpose to "implement," "edit a file," "run a test," or "do git work," that is a bug. Implementation is INLINE by the orchestrator. There is no fallback.
- **`claude`**, **`claude-code-guide`**, **`Explore`**, **`Plan`** (capital-P architect agent), **`statusline-setup`**, **`vercel:*`** — host-runtime agents from other systems. NEVER spawn from a Dreamers skill.
- **`forge`**, **`nova`** — these are USER-ENTERED personas (via `/agents forge` or `/agents nova`). Skills do NOT spawn them as subagents.
- **`bolt`** — does not exist as a subagent in this Dreamers system. Implementation, git ops, and PR creation are done INLINE by the orchestrator.
- **Anything not in the 5-item allowlist above** — NEVER.

### Runtime hard stop

Before EVERY `task` / Agent tool call, check the `agent_type` argument:

- ✅ If `agent_type` is one of `sentinel` / `probe` / `hone` / `echo` / `sage` → proceed.
- ❌ If `agent_type` is anything else → STOP. Do not spawn. The action you're about to delegate either:
  - (a) belongs to the orchestrator INLINE (writing code, writing tests, running tests, git operations, doc updates, file edits, PR creation), OR
  - (b) needs the right Dreamers agent — re-evaluate which of Sentinel / Probe / Hone / Echo / Sage fits.

There is no third option. There is no "general-purpose because I'm not sure which agent to use" path.

## What implementation looks like (NO subagent)

Implementation (writing production code, writing tests, running tests, type-checking, running build / lint / format, git operations including `add` / `commit` / `push` / `mv` / `rm`, branch setup, doc updates, PR creation via `gh`) is the orchestrator's lane — done inline using the orchestrator's Edit / Write / Bash tools. The five allowed subagents are read-only reporters (Sentinel / Probe / Hone return findings) or scoped doc-writers (Echo edits docs only) — none of them write production code or run the build.

## Read-only reviewer lanes

The three reviewer agents (Sentinel, Probe, Hone) have **`tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash`** in their frontmatter — no Write or Edit. They cannot modify files. They return structured findings per the spec in `orchestrator-discipline.md`; the orchestrator applies fixes inline.

## Conflict resolution between reviewers

When two reviewers' findings touch the same `file:line` with contradicting fixes (e.g., Sentinel `[correctness] add defensive check` vs Hone `[simplicity] remove this as over-engineering`):

- **Correctness > simplicity always.** When in conflict, the correctness/security/maintainability finding wins.
- **Genuine ambiguity surfaces to user.** If both arguments are equally strong (rare), present the conflict before applying either.

See `orchestrator-discipline.md` § "Orchestrator-as-fixer behavior" for the full handling rules.

<git-workflow>

# Git Workflow (mandatory)

Every milestone uses a feature branch + PR — never work directly on the default branch.

## Startup verification (do this FIRST)
1. Detect the repo's default branch:
   ```bash
   DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')
   [ -z "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" ] && DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name 2>/dev/null || echo "main")
   ```
   Store `$DEFAULT_BRANCH` — use it everywhere `main` would have been used.
2. `git fetch origin && git log origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH --oneline -5` — anchor to remote truth before reading any `.dreamers/` files. Workspace files are local-only and may be stale. `origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH` is the authoritative record of what is actually shipped.

## Branch setup (before invoking `/dreamers-implement`)
1. `git checkout $DEFAULT_BRANCH && git pull origin $DEFAULT_BRANCH` — never build off a stale local default branch.
2. Cut `feat/<slug>` from `$DEFAULT_BRANCH`.
3. Confirm `.dreamers/` is in the project's `.gitignore`. If not, add it before any further edits.
4. **Archive prior feature's plan directory** — check if the previous feature's PR is merged (`gh pr list --state merged` or `gh pr view <number>`):
   - **Merged:** move the entire feature directory from `.dreamers/plans/feature-<slug>/` to `.dreamers/plans/archive/feature-<slug>/` (create the archive dir if it doesn't exist). The PR description is the lasting public record; the archived feature directory is preserved locally for easy reference. Use `mv` (or `Move-Item`), not `rm` — never delete plan files. Mid-feature archive (file-by-file) is NOT allowed; only whole-feature-directory archive at the milestone-final PR merge.
   - **Not merged:** leave the feature directory in place.
   - **Note:** this step catches prior features not already archived by `/dreamers-close-out` Step 7 (the primary archive trigger). If close-out already ran on the prior feature, the source directory won't exist and the `mv` is a no-op — skip silently.
5. No init commit — the first commit for the milestone is the first thing in the PR diff.

## Commit discipline (non-negotiable)
1. **Commit at end of each cycle** — one commit per plan in the sequence (single-plan: one commit total; multi-plan: N commits, one per plan).
2. **Commit before PR creation** — a final commit capturing any last changes before opening the PR.
3. **No auto-commit after PR is created** — if changes are made after `gh pr create`, do NOT commit automatically. Ask the user first.

## Push discipline (non-negotiable)
`git push` happens EXACTLY ONCE — immediately before `gh pr create` at final close-out. Never push after intermediate commits, between cycles, or at any other point in the pipeline.

## Post-PR push discipline
If the user approves a post-PR commit, push with `git push` (no force). The PR will update automatically.

## Commit structure (one commit per cycle)
- Exactly **one** commit per plan/cycle, immediately after the reviewer findings have been applied and tests are green (and user testing, if required, is signed off).
- The orchestrator stages changes with `git add` throughout the cycle but does **not** run `git commit` until the cycle ends.
- Commit message format follows `.github/instructions/git.instructions.md` (if present). Pipeline-specific bits:
  - Subject: `feat: <plan-name>` (or `feat!: <plan-name>` for breaking changes — see git.instructions.md for the breaking-change footer rule)
  - Body: reference the plan file (e.g. `Plan: feature-auth/plan-01-login-flow`) — repo-relative path without `.md`, without `.dreamers/plans/` prefix

One commit per plan keeps each plan's contribution atomic. Reviewer-fix application is part of the same cycle (not separate commits).

## What gets committed
Nothing in `.dreamers/` is committed — all workspace files (plans, retros, improvements.md) are gitignored and stay local. Ensure `.dreamers/` is in the project's `.gitignore`.

## No worktrees
The orchestrator works directly on the feature branch. Worktrees previously caused reviewers to read stale default-branch code.

## Git history is the archive
No separate archive directories. `git log` and PR diffs are the record.

<agent-recovery>

# Agent Failure Recovery (mandatory)

When a spawned agent hits a rate limit, crashes, or times out mid-run:
1. Read whatever workspace files the agent managed to write before failing.
2. Determine which steps completed and which remain (check workspace outputs, git log, test results).
3. Complete remaining steps directly (you have Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash in the main conversation) or re-spawn the agent scoped to only the remaining work.
4. Do not re-run steps that already completed — build on partial progress.
</agent-recovery>

<implementation-procedure>
<!-- GENERATED from .github/dreamers/refs/implementation-procedure.md -- do not edit between tags; edit the source file and re-run scripts/sync-refs.ps1 -->
# Implementation Procedure (canonical)

This ref is the SOLE source of truth for the Dreamers implementation phase (one cycle per plan). Both `/dreamers-implement` (standalone) and `/dreamers-full` (end-to-end pipeline) follow this procedure for each plan in their sequence. There is no composed-mode branching.

---

## Inputs

- A **plan file path** (`.dreamers/plans/feature-<slug>/plan-NN-<name>.md`).
- The branch the cycle runs on (the orchestrator handles branch setup before invoking this procedure; this procedure assumes the correct branch is already checked out).
- Optional **shared context payload** when invoked from a manifest-mode pipeline run — the manifest's Shared constraints / design decisions / data models / end-to-end ACs are threaded into the per-cycle reviewer prompts. Skip if no shared context was passed.

## Outputs

- One commit on the branch (the cycle's commit, with `Plan: feature-<slug>/plan-NN-<name>` in the body).
- Updated `./test-benchmarks.md` row if the project uses one.

This procedure runs ONE cycle per invocation. Multi-plan sequences run this procedure N times.

The orchestrator's todo (a single list owned by the top-level skill) records cycle completion.

---

## Subagent failure recovery (applies to any reviewer invocation below)

Per `agent-recovery.md`: if Sentinel, Probe, or Hone hits a rate limit, crashes, or times out mid-run:

1. Read whatever the failing reviewer managed to write before failing (chat output, any staged files via `git status`).
2. Determine which checks completed and which remain.
3. Complete remaining work inline (the orchestrator has Read/Write/Edit/Bash) OR re-spawn the affected reviewer scoped to only the remaining work. The other two reviewers' outputs are unaffected — do not re-spawn them.
4. Do not re-run steps that already completed — build on partial progress.

---

## Step 1 — Read plan + write failing tests

Read the plan file passed as input.

Read the plan's Acceptance Criteria (numbered Given/When/Then with `*Layer: ...*` annotations per `plan-writing-guide.md`). For each AC, write at least one failing test that would verify it, at the layer the annotation specifies. There is no separate Test Cases section in the new plan format — the ACs are the test specification.

- Tests live wherever the project's test convention specifies (consult `.github/copilot-instructions.md`).
- Stage with `git add`.
- Do not run yet — they should fail.

## Step 2 — Implement

**HARD STOP — implementation is inline.** The orchestrator (running this procedure in its context) edits files directly using Edit / Write / Bash tools. **Do NOT spawn any subagent to write code.** Specifically:
- ❌ `agent_type: "general-purpose"` → FORBIDDEN. There is no general-purpose fallback for implementation.
- ❌ Any other host-runtime agent → FORBIDDEN.
- ❌ `agent_type: "forge"` / `"nova"` / `"bolt"` → FORBIDDEN (these are not subagents in this system — see `delegation.md`).
- ✅ The only `agent_type` values you may spawn during this procedure are `sentinel` / `probe` / `hone` in Step 5 (parallel review). Nothing else.

If you reach the implementation step and find yourself thinking "let me delegate this to an agent," that's the bug. The orchestrator does the implementation.

Follow the **Implementation discipline** rules in `orchestrator-discipline.md`:
- Edit only files in the plan's scope.
- No while-I'm-here cleanup, no unrelated refactors mixed with feature work.
- All `import` statements at the top of each file.
- Method-signature changes: grep the full codebase for every call site before staging.
- No spec-arguing comments in source.
- No dependency installs without explicit user approval — surface and ask first if a new dependency is required.
- Stage with `git add` as work progresses.

## Step 3 — Type-check + run tests

1. Run the project's type-check command. Fix any errors before proceeding.
2. Run the project's test command (scoped to the new tests if the runner supports it; else full suite). Use the recommended timeout from `./test-benchmarks.md` if the file exists.

If tests fail:
- Diagnose. Fix inline (production code, not the tests — the tests express the spec).
- Re-run. Repeat up to 3 attempts.
- If still failing after 3 attempts, stop and surface to the user. Do not loosen the tests to make them pass.

Update `./test-benchmarks.md` with the actual run time after the suite passes (per `testing-mandate.md`).

## Step 4 — Coverage sweep (mandatory, unskippable checklist)

After tests are green, run the coverage sweep before invoking the reviewers:

- [ ] **AC coverage matrix:** for every plan AC, name the test(s) that cover it. Any AC without a covering test → write one now.
- [ ] **Layer audit — Unit:** for each changed file, are there functions, branches, or error paths with no unit test?
- [ ] **Layer audit — Integration:** are there layer boundaries (repo↔DB, service↔API, function↔trigger) exercised by this change without an integration test?
- [ ] **Layer audit — UI / E2E:** are there user-facing flows, screen states, or navigation paths introduced or changed without a UI / E2E test? (Navigation change = E2E required, not optional.)
- [ ] **Negative + edge cases:** for each piece of non-trivial logic, is there a test for invalid input, boundary values, empty/null/max, error states?
- [ ] **Regression risks:** anything in the change that touches existing behavior — is the most likely regression covered?
- [ ] **Final missed-AC check:** re-read the plan's Acceptance Criteria one last time and confirm every AC has a green test. Hard gate.

Any gap → write the test now. Re-run the test command. Loop until all checklist items pass.

## Step 5 — Parallel review (Sentinel + Probe + Hone)

Spawn **three reviewers in parallel** in a single batched `task` call. All three are read-only / report-only; each returns structured findings in the format from `orchestrator-discipline.md`. None of them edits files.

**Subagent prompt rule (every spawn):** include the line "Do NOT call `manage_todo_list`. The orchestrator owns the todo." in each subagent's prompt. Subagents must not touch the todo mechanism — that's the orchestrator's lane.

Common prompt context for all three:
- Plan file path
- Scope: list of changed files from `git status`
- Branch + default branch names
- What the orchestrator has done: written failing tests, implemented, type-checked, ran tests (passing), completed coverage sweep.
- **Shared context (if applicable)** — when manifest-mode is in effect, the orchestrator passes the manifest's Shared constraints + Shared design decisions + Shared data models + End-to-end ACs verbatim under a "Feature context" header. Reviewers use this to evaluate the current plan in light of the full feature.

Per-reviewer prompt addition:

**Sentinel** (`agent_type: "sentinel"`, `mode: "sync"`):
- Lenses: correctness, security, maintainability.
- Out of scope: test coverage (Probe's lane), simplicity (Hone's lane).
- Return: structured findings per the spec, plus plan-alignment summary.

**Probe** (`agent_type: "probe"`, `mode: "sync"`):
- Lens: test coverage (AC matrix, layer audit, edge cases, gaps).
- Out of scope: correctness/security/maintainability (Sentinel's lane), simplicity (Hone's lane).
- Return: structured findings per the spec, plus plan AC coverage table.

**Hone** (`agent_type: "hone"`, `mode: "sync"`):
- Lens: simplicity / over-engineering / redundancy / architectural quality.
- Out of scope: correctness/security/maintainability (Sentinel's lane), test coverage (Probe's lane).
- Return: structured findings per the spec.
- **Mandate reinforcement (include in Hone's prompt verbatim):** "Aggressively flag bad architecture, over-engineering, redundancy, and simpler alternatives. Refactor cost is NOT a moderating factor — do not soften, hedge, or omit findings because the fix is big. When the suggested fix has architectural scope (touches files outside the plan, requires a new module, requires schema or symbol changes, or amounts to a full refactor of a subsystem), state the scope explicitly in the suggested-fix text. The orchestrator's major-refactor finding gate (per `orchestrator-discipline.md`) routes those findings through the user for apply-now vs defer decisions. Your job is to surface; the gate handles disposition."

## Step 6 — Apply findings inline (orchestrator-as-fixer)

Concatenate findings from all three reviewers per the orchestrator-as-fixer behavior in `orchestrator-discipline.md`:

1. **Sort by severity** (critical → high → medium → low).
2. **Resolve conflicts** per the conflict-resolution rule: correctness > simplicity. Genuine ambiguity → surface to user before applying.
3. **Evaluate each finding against the Major-refactor finding gate** per `orchestrator-discipline.md` § "Major-refactor finding gate." For each finding, check the closed 6-criterion checklist (new module / schema change / cross-cutting refactor / new exported symbols / files outside plan scope / Hone-recommended full refactor). If ANY criterion fires, call `request_information` with the 3-choice template from the canonical rule (`Apply now — refactor in this cycle` / `Defer — create follow-up plan` / `Other`) and route per the user's answer. On `Defer`, create the stub plan file at `.dreamers/plans/feature-<deferred-slug>/plan-01-<short-slug>.md` per the canonical template; do NOT apply the fix. The orchestrator NEVER silently applies a gate-triggering finding, regardless of severity.
4. **Apply each (non-deferred) fix inline** as a targeted Edit. Stage with `git add` as you go. Findings that didn't trigger the gate, OR that the user opted to `Apply now` via the gate, apply here.
5. **Re-run type-check + tests** after all fixes applied. If regressions appear, diagnose + re-fix inline (up to 3 attempts, then surface to user).

Handle non-finding outputs:
- Any reviewer returns **`Blocked — <reason>`** → halt cycle; surface; resolve; re-spawn the affected reviewer only.
- Any reviewer returns **open questions** → present each to the user before proceeding. Capture decisions; apply.
- All three return **`Approved — no findings`** → proceed to Step 7 directly. No fix application needed.

After fix application (or skip + any deferred stubs written), proceed to Step 7.

## Step 7 — User testing (if required)

Check the plan's `User-testing-required` field.

- **`no`** → proceed directly to Step 8.
- **`yes`** → pause the cycle by calling `request_information`. Do not commit until the user explicitly approves.

The `request_information` call MUST include every item below:

- **Plan being tested:** ID + full path (e.g. `plan-01-section-scorer` → `.dreamers/plans/feature-plan-quality-scoring/plan-01-section-scorer.md`).
- **Build / distribution details:** check for `.github/instructions/build.instructions.md` at the project root.
  - **If present:** follow it exactly. Execute only the steps it explicitly authorises the orchestrator to run. Surface every user-action step verbatim.
  - **If absent:** state plainly that there is no `build.instructions.md`. Ask the user to either build/distribute the test build themselves and confirm when ready, OR provide the steps so a `build.instructions.md` can be created. Do not invent build steps.
- **What changed in this cycle:** 1–3 bullets summarising the user-visible behaviour delivered.
- **Step-by-step test steps:** numbered, concrete, reproducible. Derive directly from the plan's Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then with Layer annotations).
- **Known limitations / out-of-scope:** anything the user might try that this cycle deliberately doesn't cover.
- **How to respond:**
  - `Approved — continue` (procedure proceeds to Step 8)
  - `Bug: <description>` (procedure fixes inline, re-runs tests, re-distributes per `build.instructions.md` rules, re-calls `request_information` with refreshed test steps)
  - Freeform notes / corrections are also accepted and treated as bugs unless clearly approving.

**Resume rules:**
- On `Approved — continue` → proceed to Step 8.
- On any bug or correction → **fix inline.** No Sentinel re-invocation: during user-testing rounds, the user IS the test layer. Diagnose → fix in production code → re-run the test command → re-build/distribute → re-call `request_information` with refreshed test steps. Do NOT commit until explicit approval.

## Step 8 — Commit the cycle

Run `git status` to confirm staged content. Run `git commit` with a message following the project's commit-message style (see `.github/instructions/git.instructions.md` if present).

**Plan reference (mandatory):** the commit body MUST include a line of the form:

```
Plan: feature-<slug>/plan-NN-<name>
```

Repo-relative plan path WITHOUT the `.md` extension and WITHOUT the `.dreamers/plans/` prefix. Example: `Plan: feature-plan-quality-scoring/plan-01-section-scorer`. This format is required for `/dreamers-close-out` standalone auto-detection to find the plan.

One commit per cycle. Do NOT push — push happens at close-out per `pr-procedure.md`.

---

## What happens after this procedure ends

This procedure ends at Step 8 commit. What happens next depends on the consuming skill:

- **`/dreamers-full`** (end-to-end pipeline): the orchestrator's todo records this cycle complete and moves to the next plan in the sequence (if multi-plan) OR proceeds to close-out (if last plan).
- **`/dreamers-implement`** (standalone): exit with success. Surface the commit hash and AC coverage matrix to the user. Next step (their choice): more cycles via another `/dreamers-implement` invocation against the next plan, OR `/dreamers-close-out` if all plans are shipped.

Either consumer maintains its own todo (single-owner rule). This procedure does not touch the todo.

# Comment Rules

## Core principle
Comments must add value that the code cannot express itself. Concise, no fluff, no separators — value only.

## When to comment
- Non-obvious logic: why a non-obvious approach was chosen, constraints, gotchas
- Public API documentation callers need to use the interface correctly
- TODO/FIXME with specific, actionable notes
- License headers

## When NOT to comment
- Code that reads naturally from well-named functions and variables
- Anything that restates what the code obviously does (`const isRunning` does not need `// tracks whether running`)

## Strict prohibitions
- **No plan/ticket references** — never mention plan files, milestone names (D25, plan-3), ticket numbers, or agent names in source code
- **No separator comments** — never use `// ---`, `// ===`, `// ###`, blank-comment lines, or visual dividers
- **No spec rationalization** — never write comments arguing a spec permits a pattern; implement cleanly and let review judge
- **No redundant JSDoc/KDoc** that only repeats the function signature

## Style
- One line when possible; never exceed two lines for inline comments
- Write *why*, never *what*
- If a comment requires more than two lines to be useful, the code needs refactoring, not more words
</comment-rules>

# Testing Coverage Mandate (MANDATORY)

Every plan must express its test coverage intent through the Acceptance Criteria's Layer annotations. The planner specifies *what observable outcome* the AC requires and *which test layer* covers it. The implementer (orchestrator at `/dreamers-implement` Step 1) writes the actual tests from each AC's Given/When/Then.

## How test coverage is expressed in plans (new format)

Plan ACs are numbered Given/When/Then statements with a Layer annotation per AC. See `plan-writing-guide.md` § "Acceptance Criteria format" for the canonical spec.

```
<acceptance_criteria>
1. Given <state>, when <trigger>, then <observable outcome>.
   *Layer: unit.*
2. Given <state>, when <trigger>, then <observable outcome>.
   *Layer: integration.*
3. Given <state>, when <trigger>, then <observable outcome>.
   *Layer: E2E.*
</acceptance_criteria>
```

Layer label set (closed): `unit` / `integration` / `E2E` / `perf`. Compound labels allowed when one assertion serves two purposes (e.g., `*Layer: integration / perf.*`).

**Test coverage intent is expressed via the `*Layer: ...*` annotation on each Acceptance Criterion — not via a standalone Test Cases section.** Do not write a separate Test Cases section in a plan; embed the test layer directly in the AC. This keeps ACs and test specification in one place so they never drift.

## Coverage requirement (every plan)

Across all of a plan's ACs, the layer mix must cover the following whenever applicable to the work — think through each layer explicitly:

**Unit layer**
- Each significant function, method, or class in isolation.
- All branches: happy path, edge cases (boundary values, empty/null/max), negative cases (invalid input, error states).
- Any pure logic that does not require a real device, network, or database.

**Integration layer**
- Interactions between layers: repository ↔ data source, ViewModel ↔ repository, service ↔ external API.
- Database reads/writes (real or in-memory, not mocked).
- Auth flows end-to-end within the backend.
- Cloud function triggers and side-effects.

**UI / E2E layer**
- Full user journeys through the UI: screen load → interaction → outcome visible on screen.
- Navigation flows between screens.
- Error and empty states rendered correctly in the UI.
- Any flow that requires a real device or emulator.
- **Navigation change rule (mandatory):** When a plan changes how a nav element behaves (tab tap, modal open, screen transition), the plan must include at least one AC with `*Layer: E2E.*` — not just unit/integration. Probe enforces this in the layer audit and blocks if missing.

**Regression risks**
- Anything touching existing behavior that could break — call out the specific existing test or flow at risk in the plan's Context section.

If a layer cannot be covered automatically (e.g., camera permission flows), flag it explicitly as a manual-verification requirement in the plan's Verification section with a reason.

## Probe's layer audit (consumes the new format)

In `/dreamers-implement` Step 4 (coverage sweep) and Step 5 (parallel review with Probe), the layer audit reads each AC's `*Layer: ...*` annotation to verify coverage at each layer was implemented. Probe blocks the cycle if any AC's annotated layer lacks a corresponding green test.

## Test benchmarks

Each project that uses `/dreamers-implement` maintains a `./test-benchmarks.md` file at the project root. The file records measured run times per test command so the orchestrator can set realistic timeouts.

- **File path:** `./test-benchmarks.md` at the project root (committed to version control).
- **Recommended-timeout formula:** `max(last_run_time × 2, 30s)` — the 2× multiplier accounts for machine variance; 30s is a non-negotiable floor.
- **Orchestrator updates** the row for each test command after every successful test run. **Humans may edit** the `Notes` column to capture CI environment factors or known flakiness.
- Template: `.github/dreamers/templates/test-benchmarks.md` (catalog-relative; resolves to `~/.copilot/dreamers/templates/test-benchmarks.md` at install).

## Why this matters

Layer-annotated ACs prevent Probe from guessing intent. The Given/When/Then format forces specificity about preconditions and expected outcomes; the Layer annotation forces specificity about which test layer covers each AC. Together they reduce ambiguity at the planning → implementation handoff without duplicating content across multiple plan sections.

$ARGUMENTS

---

## Todo list (single owner: this skill)

At skill entry, declare via `manage_todo_list`:

- [ ] Read implementation-procedure.md
- [ ] Read plan file
- [ ] Step 1 — write failing tests
- [ ] Step 2 — implement (inline)
- [ ] Step 3 — type-check + run tests
- [ ] Step 4 — coverage sweep
- [ ] Step 5 — parallel review (Sentinel + Probe + Hone)
- [ ] Step 6 — apply reviewer findings + re-run tests
- [ ] Step 7 — user testing (if plan requires it)
- [ ] Step 8 — commit the cycle

Mark each item `in_progress` when starting, `completed` when done. Never batch completions at the end.

**Subagent prompt rule:** when this skill spawns Sentinel / Probe / Hone in Step 5, include the line "Do NOT call `manage_todo_list`. The orchestrator owns the todo." in each subagent's prompt. Per `orchestration-flow.md` § "Single-owner todo."

---

## MANDATORY first actions (in order, once at skill entry)

1. **Read `.dreamers/improvements.md`** if it exists. For every open improvement item, action it or explicitly re-defer with a note.

2. **Branch setup (inline, per `git-workflow.md`):**
   - Detect default branch (canonical two-step):
     ```bash
     DEFAULT=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')
     [ -z "$DEFAULT" ] && DEFAULT=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name 2>/dev/null || echo "main")
     ```
   - **Anchor to remote truth (mandatory before reading any `.dreamers/` files):** `git fetch origin && git log origin/$DEFAULT --oneline -5`.
   - If currently on default branch: `git checkout $DEFAULT && git pull origin $DEFAULT`, then cut `feat/<slug>` from `$DEFAULT`.
   - If already on a feature branch: confirm via `git branch --show-current`. Stay on it.
   - Confirm `.dreamers/` is in `.gitignore`. If not, add it before any further edits.

3. **Branch identity check** — `git log --oneline -3`. Confirm branch + recent commits match the expected feature.

---

## Procedure

Follow `~/.copilot/dreamers/refs/implementation-procedure.md` Step 1 through Step 8, exactly as written. The procedure handles:

- Writing failing tests against the plan's ACs (Step 1)
- Inline implementation with the HARD STOP block on agent spawning (Step 2)
- Type-checking + running tests (Step 3)
- Coverage sweep (Step 4)
- Parallel Sentinel + Probe + Hone review (Step 5)
- Orchestrator-as-fixer applying findings (Step 6)
- User-testing pause if `User-testing-required: yes` in the plan (Step 7)
- Final commit with the `Plan: feature-<slug>/plan-NN-<name>` body line (Step 8)

Update this skill's todo as each step completes.

---

## Exit behavior

On Step 8 commit, exit with success. Tell the user:
- Commit hash + summary.
- AC coverage matrix.
- Reviewer status (Sentinel + Probe + Hone).
- Next step (their choice): more cycles (next plan, another `/dreamers-implement` invocation), OR `/dreamers-close-out` if all plans are shipped.

This skill does NOT proceed to close-out automatically. The user is in control.

---

## Push discipline

`git push` does NOT happen in this skill. Push happens exactly once at PR close-out via `pr-procedure.md` (invoked from `close-out-procedure.md` Step 6).

---

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT push.
- Does NOT open a PR.
- Does NOT update docs (Echo is invoked at close-out, not here).
- Does NOT invoke `/dreamers-close-out` or any other skill. The user runs close-out themselves when ready.
- Does NOT spawn agents outside the 5-item allowlist (`sentinel`, `probe`, `hone`, `echo`, `sage`). In this skill, only Sentinel + Probe + Hone are used (in Step 5).
