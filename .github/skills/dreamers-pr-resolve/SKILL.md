Resolve unresolved PR review comments. All work inline except a parallel review pass (Sentinel + Probe + Hone) over the accepted changes.

Follow the Dreamers Kernel and output discipline from `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md`.

## Inlined ref content

Refs below are inlined from `.github/dreamers/refs/` by `scripts/sync-refs.ps1`. Do NOT edit between the XML tags — edit the source file and re-run sync.

# Dreamers Kernel

Universal rules. Inlined at the bottom of every Dreamers skill + agent by `scripts/sync-refs.ps1`.

## Subagent allowlist (HARD RULE)

The only `agent_type` values a skill may pass to `task()`:
- `sentinel`, `probe`, `hone`, `echo`, `sage`

Forbidden: `general-purpose`, `claude`, `claude-code-guide`, `Explore`, `Plan`, `bolt`, or any non-Dreamers agent. Exception: only if the user explicitly authorizes a fallback in the current run.

## Single-owner todo

Each user-invoked skill owns its own todo for its run. When skills compose (e.g., `/dreamers-full` invokes `/dreamers-implement`), the called skill creates its own todo on entry and closes it on exit. Sub-skills do not touch the caller's todo.

## Mandatory subagent prompt line

Every `task()` invocation MUST include this line in the prompt:

```
Do NOT call `manage_todo_list`. The skill that invoked you owns its todo.
```

## Implementation discipline

- **Plan adherence:** edit only files in the plan's scope. No while-I'm-here cleanup, no unrelated refactors mixed with feature work.
- **No spec-arguing comments:** never add a code comment that argues the spec permits a pattern.
- **Branch identity check:** before the first edit, `git log --oneline -3`. Confirm the branch and recent commits match the expected feature. If not, halt and surface.
- **No dependency installs without permission.** Don't run `npm install`, `pip install`, etc. without explicit user approval.
- **Type-check before declaring implementation done.** Run the project's type-check command from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and fix errors before moving on.

# Orchestration flow — single-owner todo, continuation principle

Single source of truth for the orchestration principles that apply across all Dreamers skills.

---

## Single-owner todo rule (HARD RULE)

There is exactly ONE todo list per user-invoked skill run. The skill the user invoked at the top level (`/dreamers-full`, `/dreamers-plan`, `/dreamers-implement`, `/dreamers-fix`, `/dreamers-close-out`, etc.) owns the todo for the duration of its run. No other entity touches it.

### What the orchestrator does

At skill entry:
- Declare the todo via `manage_todo_list`. Each item corresponds to one major phase or step. Declare all items upfront; do not add items mid-run.

During the run:
- Mark the active item `in_progress` when starting.
- Mark it `completed` when done.
- Never batch completions at the end. The todo is a live progress indicator, not a retrospective log.
- Before every meaningful step, re-read the todo to confirm position — the todo is the authoritative "where am I" signal, not chat context.

At skill exit:
- All items should be `completed` (or explicitly noted as deferred/skipped, with reason).

### What subagents do NOT do

Subagents spawned by the orchestrator (Sentinel, Probe, Hone, Echo, Sage) do NOT touch the todo. Their prompts MUST include the line:

> "Do NOT call `manage_todo_list`. The orchestrator owns the todo."

A subagent that creates its own todo creates a parallel state that drifts from the orchestrator's. Don't do it.

### No composed-mode handoff

There is no "composed mode" for the todo. Skills do not invoke other skills as runtime sub-routines in this system. Each user-invoked skill runs end-to-end with its own todo. When a user wants the full pipeline, they run `/dreamers-full`; when they want only planning, they run `/dreamers-plan`; etc. Each run has one owner, one todo, one exit.

This rule replaces the previous "composed vs standalone — sub-skill updates parent's matching item" pattern, which created multi-owner todo state and was the root cause of mid-pipeline progress lapses.

### Granularity

One todo item per major phase or clearly distinct step. Not one per line of work. Not one per sub-step within a phase. Scannable overview, not micro-log.

---

## Continuation principle

### Definition

The orchestrator MUST NOT silently halt mid-feature. At every natural pause — where a phase ends and a meaningful choice about what to do next exists — the orchestrator calls `request_information` with a structured choice block. The user picks `Continue`, `Halt for now`, or `Other (freeform)`. No silent forward progress; no silent stops.

### Pause-point list

The following are the canonical natural pauses where a continuation prompt is required:

1. Between ATOMIC cycles in a multi-plan loop, after each plan's commit and drift check, before the next cycle starts — only when more plans remain.
2. Between LIGHT close-outs in INCREMENTAL multi-plan mode, after each per-plan PR opens, before the next cycle starts — only when more plans remain.

**Approval gates are NOT continuation prompts.** Phase 1c (proposal approval), Phase 1g (plan-file approval), and close-out Step 5 (push approval) each carry their own decision. They do not need a follow-up "do you want to continue?" prompt after they fire. Phase 1g's `Approved — start implementation` answer is itself the proceed signal — no second gate fires between Phase 1g and Phase 1.5 / Phase 2.

### Prompt template

Use this shape for every continuation prompt:

```
<status summary — one sentence stating what just completed>

<concrete next action — one sentence stating what will happen if the user says Continue>

Options:
- label: Continue — <specific yes-action label>
- label: Halt for now — No (halt; resume later)
- label: Other — freeform redirect
```

Call `request_information` with at minimum these three choices. The `Continue` label must name the concrete next action (e.g., "start next cycle for feature-auth/plan-02-logout.md").

### Halt behavior

On `Halt for now` at any continuation prompt: halt cleanly. Output one line stating the resume command:

```
Resume by re-invoking `/dreamers-full` with the remaining plan paths: <paths>
```

(Adapt the resume command to whichever skill the user was running.)

Do not leave partial state dangling. Stage nothing new. Do not proceed.

On `Other`: treat the freeform input as a redirect instruction. Acknowledge it, confirm the new direction, and proceed accordingly.

---

## Tool naming convention

Skills in this system reference two tools by pseudonym. Runtime resolves the pseudonym to whatever Copilot CLI surfaces as the actual tool name at the time of invocation.

| Pseudonym | Tool | What it does |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| `request_information` | Copilot CLI user-prompt tool | Pauses the orchestrator, presents a message and structured choices, waits for the user's response |
| `manage_todo_list` | Copilot CLI todo tool | Creates, updates, and marks items in a persistent todo list visible to the user |

When a skill says "call `request_information`" or "declare via `manage_todo_list`", it means: invoke the tool Copilot CLI has bound to that function at runtime. The pseudonym names are stable across skill files regardless of CLI version.

### Legacy convention note

The `.github/agents/nova.agent.md` file retains the older `ask_user` pseudonym (predates this ref). It is functionally equivalent to `request_information`. Out of scope for the current alignment pass; tracked as a follow-up to harmonize agent files with the skill convention.

$ARGUMENTS

---

## Todo list

At skill entry, declare via `manage_todo_list`:
- [ ] Read review comments (discover PR + pull unresolved threads via GraphQL)
- [ ] Categorize threads (accept/reject decision per thread)
- [ ] Apply accepted fixes inline + run tests
- [ ] Spawn parallel review of accepted changes (Sentinel + Probe + Hone)
- [ ] Resolve accepted threads + commit + report

Mark each item `in_progress` when starting, `completed` when done. Never batch completions at the end.

---

## Step 1 — Discover open PRs

Run `gh pr list --state open` to find all live PRs. If a specific PR is provided in `$ARGUMENTS`, use that one. If multiple are open and none is specified, call `request_information` with each open PR as a choice (format: `#NUM — <title>`) plus `"Other"` for freeform input. If exactly one is open, use it without prompting.

## Step 2 — Pull unresolved review threads (GraphQL only)

For the target PR, use GraphQL to get only the unresolved threads (the REST API `resolved` field is unreliable — always use GraphQL):

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='{ repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") { pullRequest(number: N) { reviewThreads(first: 50) { nodes { isResolved id comments(first: 1) { nodes { path body } } } } } } }'
```

Extract only threads where `isResolved: false`. Capture each thread's `id`, `path`, and `body`. If there are none, report that back to the user and stop.

## Step 3 — Decide accept / reject per thread (inline)

**HARD STOP — fix application is inline.** The orchestrator (this skill) edits files directly using Edit / Write / Bash tools to apply accepted PR-feedback fixes. **Do NOT spawn any subagent to write the fix code.** Specifically:
- ❌ `agent_type: "general-purpose"` → FORBIDDEN. There is no general-purpose fallback for implementation.
- ❌ `agent_type: "claude"` or any other host-runtime agent → FORBIDDEN.
- ❌ `agent_type: "forge"` / `"nova"` / `"bolt"` → FORBIDDEN (these are not subagents in this system — see `delegation.md`).
- ✅ The only `agent_type` values you may spawn from this skill are `sentinel`, `probe`, `hone` in Step 5 (parallel review of the applied fixes). Nothing else.

For each unresolved thread, judge whether to accept or reject the comment. You are the implementation expert and have full authority. **Do not feel obligated to accept every comment** — if a suggestion conflicts with the plan, the architecture, or is simply wrong, reject it and say why.

For each thread, record:
- Thread ID
- Path + comment body (one-line summary)
- Decision: **accept** or **reject**
- Rationale: one sentence

If **accept** → apply the fix inline (Edit the file). Stage with `git add`. Follow the comment + implementation discipline from `orchestrator-discipline.md`.

If **reject** → no edit. Note in chat for the final report.

## Step 4 — Run tests after accepted changes

If any threads were accepted:
- Run the project's type-check command (from project `.github/copilot-instructions.md`). Fix any errors before proceeding.
- Run the project's test command. Fix any regressions inline. Up to 3 attempts.

If no threads were accepted, skip to Step 6.

## Step 5 — Parallel review of accepted changes (Sentinel + Probe + Hone)

Spawn **three reviewers in parallel** in a single batched tool call (whatever the runtime surfaces for parallel agent spawning). All three are read-only / report-only; each returns structured findings in the format from `orchestrator-discipline.md`. Scope is restricted to ONLY the files touched by accepted threads.

Common prompt context for all three (subagent prompt rule — include verbatim):
- **Todo discipline:** "Do NOT call `manage_todo_list`. The orchestrator owns the todo." (per `~/.copilot/dreamers/refs/orchestration-flow.md` § "Single-owner todo rule")
- Plan file: none (ad-hoc PR-feedback work, no plan binding) — mark plan-alignment summary as N/A
- Scope: list of files changed by accepted threads from `git status`
- Branch + default branch names
- What the orchestrator has done: addressed N accepted PR review comments via inline edits; type-checked + tests green.

Per-reviewer prompt addition:

**Sentinel** (`agent_type: "sentinel"`, `mode: "sync"`) — correctness, security, maintainability lenses.

**Probe** (`agent_type: "probe"`, `mode: "sync"`) — test coverage lens (did the PR-feedback fixes break or weaken test coverage?).

**Hone** (`agent_type: "hone"`, `mode: "sync"`) — simplicity lens (did the fixes introduce over-engineering or redundancy?).
- **Mandate reinforcement (include in Hone's prompt verbatim):** "Aggressively flag bad architecture, over-engineering, redundancy, and simpler alternatives. Refactor cost is NOT a moderating factor — do not soften, hedge, or omit findings because the fix is big. When the suggested fix has architectural scope (touches files outside the PR-feedback surface, requires a new module, requires schema or symbol changes, or amounts to a full refactor of a subsystem), state the scope explicitly in the suggested-fix text. The orchestrator's major-refactor finding gate (per `orchestrator-discipline.md`) routes those findings through the user for apply-now vs defer decisions. Your job is to surface; the gate handles disposition."

Apply findings inline per the orchestrator-as-fixer behavior in `orchestrator-discipline.md`:

1. Sort findings by severity.
2. Resolve conflicts per the rule (correctness > simplicity).
3. **Evaluate each finding against the Major-refactor finding gate** per `orchestrator-discipline.md` § "Major-refactor finding gate." If ANY criterion fires for a finding (new module / schema change / cross-cutting refactor / new exported symbols / files outside the PR-feedback surface / Hone-style "tear out X" scope language), call `request_information` with the 3-choice template (`Apply now — refactor in this cycle` / `Defer — create follow-up plan` / `Other`) and route per the user's answer. On `Defer`, create the stub plan file per the canonical template; do NOT apply the deferred fix.
4. Apply each (non-deferred) fix inline; stage with `git add`.
5. Re-run type-check + tests; fix regressions inline (up to 3 attempts).

Handle non-finding outputs:
- Any reviewer returns `Blocked` → halt; surface; resolve; re-spawn that reviewer.
- Open questions → present to user before proceeding.
- All three `Approved — no findings` → proceed to Step 6 directly.

## Step 6 — Commit accepted fixes (if any)

If any fixes landed (Step 3 accepted + Step 5 reviewer findings applied):

```bash
git status                # confirm staged content
git commit -m "fix: address PR feedback"
```

Use a single commit covering all the PR-feedback fixes. Commit message per `.github/instructions/git.instructions.md` if present.

Per `close-out-procedure.md` Step 8 post-PR discipline: **do not push yet.** Call `request_information` with `["Push to PR", "Hold — don't push yet", "Other"]` and a summary of the staged commit (hash, files touched, accepted thread count).

Only push after explicit `Push to PR` approval: `git push`. On `Hold` → stop with status; the commit stays on the branch for the user to push manually.

## Step 7 — Resolve accepted threads via gh api

For each thread marked **accept** in Step 3, resolve it:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: { threadId: "THREAD_ID" }) { thread { isResolved } } }'
```

Leave rejected threads open — they represent active disagreements the reviewer should see.

## Step 8 — Report

Report to the user:
- N comments accepted (with one-line path + decision rationale per accept)
- M comments rejected (with one-line path + rejection rationale per reject)
- Threads remaining open (the M rejected ones)
- Commit hash + push status
- Reviewer results (Sentinel + Probe + Hone)

This skill does NOT update the PR description, does NOT re-request review, does NOT close the PR. Those are user actions.
