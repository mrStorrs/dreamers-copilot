# Reviewer Findings Format

**Status line** (one of):
- `Approved — no findings`
- `Findings reported — N items`
- `Blocked — <reason>`

**Findings** (if any) — one bullet per finding, exact format:

```
[severity] [lens-tag] file:line — what was wrong → suggested fix
```

- `severity` ∈ `critical` / `high` / `medium` / `low`
- `lens-tag` ∈ `correctness` / `security` / `maintainability` (Sentinel) / `test-coverage` (Probe) / `simplicity` (Hone)
- `file:line` — absolute or repo-relative path + line number
- `what was wrong → suggested fix` — one-line description + targeted fix the caller can apply mechanically

**Observations** (optional) — out-of-scope notes that aren't findings. The caller may or may not act on them.

**Open questions** (optional) — items needing user judgment. Use "none" if no questions.

Reviewers are read-only / report-only. The caller applies fixes per its own orchestrator-as-fixer behavior.
