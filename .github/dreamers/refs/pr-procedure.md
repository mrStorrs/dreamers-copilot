# PR-Creation Procedure (canonical — read in full, no skipping)

This ref is the SOLE source of truth for the push + PR-creation step in the Dreamers pipeline. Consumers read it in full and follow it inline:

- `close-out-procedure.md` Step 6 (FULL or LIGHT close-out).
- `/dreamers-fix` Step 8.
- `/dreamers-pr-resolve` does NOT use this — it pushes updates to an existing PR, not creates a new one.

**MUST-READ rule:** any skill or procedure citing this ref MUST load this file in full using the `view` tool from top to bottom — no `grep`, no `head`, no pattern-matching shortcut. Read every line before starting the procedure.

## Inputs

The orchestrator running this procedure must have these inputs ready (passed in the prompt context or already captured from earlier phases):

- **Branch name** — current feature branch (`fix/<slug>` for bug-fix flow, `feat/<slug>` for feature flow).
- **Default branch name** — `$DEFAULT` from earlier branch setup.
- **Plan file paths** — list of plan paths shipped this PR. Pass:
  - For milestone close-out (FULL): all plans in the feature directory.
  - For per-plan PR (LIGHT close-out, INCREMENTAL ship strategy): the single plan just completed.
  - For bug-fix flow (`/dreamers-fix`): the sentinel string `none — bug fix, no plan file` (literal value; the procedure handles the absence via the Summary fallback rule below).
- **Retro file path** — from FULL close-out Step 3. Omitted in LIGHT close-out and bug-fix flow.
- **Sentinel summary string** — concatenated reviewer outputs across cycles (FULL) or single cycle (LIGHT, bug-fix).
- **Issue reference** (optional) — number or URL. If provided, the procedure closes the issue after PR open.
- **Final commit hash** — from the most recent commit on the branch (the one being pushed).

## Outputs

- Branch pushed to origin with upstream tracking.
- PR opened against the default branch.
- Optionally: issue closed with a comment referencing the PR URL.
- PR URL returned to the caller.

The orchestrator's todo records each step's completion. This procedure does not touch the todo.

## Mandatory pre-push verification

Before pushing, verify:

1. **Branch identity** — `git branch --show-current` must NOT be the default branch. If on default, halt with error: "Refuse to push: working tree is on $DEFAULT, not a feature branch."
2. **Working tree clean** — `git status --porcelain` must be empty. If not, halt: "Working tree has uncommitted changes; commit them before opening the PR." (If invoked from close-out, this should already be handled by close-out Step 4 final commit; if not, surface the discrepancy.)
3. **Branch is ahead of remote** — `git log origin/$(git branch --show-current)..HEAD` should have commits, or the branch should not yet exist on remote. If the branch exists on remote and is up-to-date with local, halt: "Nothing to push." (Edge case: re-running this procedure on an already-pushed branch.)
4. **No force-push intent** — never use `--force` or `--force-with-lease` for the initial push. If a previous push exists and there's divergence, halt and ask the user.

## Step 1 — Push

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

This is the ONLY push in the milestone pipeline. If push fails:
- **Rejected (non-fast-forward):** halt; surface the error. Ask the user how to proceed. Do not auto-force.
- **Network / auth error:** halt; surface; the user resolves credentials.
- **Hook failure:** halt; surface the pre-push hook output; do not skip hooks.

## Step 2 — Draft PR body

Use `~/.copilot/dreamers/templates/pr-description.md` as the base template. Fill in:

- **Summary** — one paragraph: plan title + 1–3 bullets of what was delivered + why.
  - **Bug-fix fallback (plan paths sentinel = `none — bug fix, no plan file`, OR plan paths absent):** derive the Summary from the most recent commit's body — specifically the `Bug:` line written by `/dreamers-fix` — plus 1–2 bullets drawn from the Sentinel summary string describing what changed and why. Do NOT attempt to read the sentinel string as a filesystem path. Do NOT scan `.dreamers/plans/` looking for a matching file.
- **Test counts** — only if test platforms are touched. Otherwise omit the section.
- **Fixes applied** — severity-graded list from the Sentinel summary string.

Title format: short (under 70 chars). Body details, not the title. Bug-fix invocations use the `fix:` prefix; milestone / plan invocations use the appropriate prefix per `.github/instructions/git.instructions.md` (if present).

### Co-authored attribution (mandatory)

Any co-author trailer in commit messages MUST use the standard git trailer key + this exact author identity:

```
Co-authored-by: The Dreamers System <noreply@dreamers.local>
```

Notes:
- Key must be exactly `Co-authored-by:` (git's standard trailer key) so `git interpret-trailers` and GitHub recognize the line.
- Author name is always `The Dreamers System` — never a specific model name. The system is the contributor; model identity ages poorly.
- The `<noreply@dreamers.local>` email is a placeholder — it won't link to a GitHub profile, but it satisfies the trailer's required `Name <email>` format.

The PR body should NOT include a `Co-authored-by:` line — co-author trailers belong on commits, not on PR descriptions.

## Step 3 — Open the PR

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "<short title>" \
  --body "<drafted body>" \
  --base <DEFAULT_BRANCH>
```

Capture the returned PR URL.

If `gh pr create` fails:
- **Authentication:** halt; ask user to `gh auth login`.
- **PR already exists for this branch:** halt; surface the existing URL.
- **Repo permission denied:** halt; surface.

## Step 4 — Issue close (if applicable)

If an issue number/URL was provided as an input:

```bash
gh issue close <number> --comment "Resolved in <PR URL>"
```

If the issue close fails, surface the error but do not roll back the PR — the PR is valid even if the issue close has problems.

## What happens after this procedure ends

Return the PR URL to the caller (close-out procedure, `/dreamers-fix`, etc.). The caller continues with whatever step follows in its own procedure (post-PR discipline for FULL close-out, exit-with-PR-URL for bug-fix flow, etc.).

This procedure does not touch the orchestrator's todo. The caller maintains it.
