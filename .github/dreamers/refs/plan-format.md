Use this structure for every plan type. Keep decisions, contracts, UI details, and risks in Scope and context only when relevant. Acceptance Criteria carry validation intent; do not add separate Approach, Verification, or Test Cases sections.

Include the transcript link only when the sibling artifact exists. Compound layers are allowed when one assertion serves both purposes. Under the relevant AC, add a test command or check when project instructions and the outcome are insufficient. For manual checks, include the steps, expected result, and why automation cannot cover them; set `User-testing-required: yes`.
