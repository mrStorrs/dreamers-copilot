### Grill

Resolve decisions and their dependencies until the goal, scope, and constraints are understood. Explore the codebase for answers before asking the user. For unresolved decisions, use `request_information`, one blocking question at a time, with exactly:

1. Recommended answer, labeled recommended.
2. Strongest viable alternative.
3. `Other` for freeform direction.

Incorporate each answer before continuing. Do not propose while required decisions remain open.

Capture every question and response verbatim, in order, including complete tool questions, choice labels, and descriptions. Keep responses separate; never summarize, paraphrase, normalize, or omit text. When writing plans, save the exchange to `.dreamers/plans/feature-<slug>/grilling-transcript.md`, adding only speaker/sequence headings. Do not create an empty transcript.
