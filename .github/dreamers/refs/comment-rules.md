# Comment Rules

## Core principle
Comments must add value that the code cannot express itself. Concise, no fluff, no separators — value only.

## When to comment
- Non-obvious logic: why a non-obvious approach was chosen, constraints, gotchas
- Public API documentation callers need to use the interface correctly
- TODO/FIXME with specific, actionable notes
- License headers

## When NOT to comment
- Code that reads naturally from well-named functions and variables
- Anything that restates what the code obviously does (`const isRunning` does not need `// tracks whether running`)

## Strict prohibitions
- **No plan/ticket references** — never mention plan files, milestone names (D25, plan-3), ticket numbers, or agent names in source code
- **No separator comments** — never use `// ---`, `// ===`, `// ###`, blank-comment lines, or visual dividers
- **No spec rationalization** — never write comments arguing a spec permits a pattern; implement cleanly and let review judge
- **No redundant JSDoc/KDoc** that only repeats the function signature

## Style
- One line when possible; never exceed two lines for inline comments
- Write *why*, never *what*
- If a comment requires more than two lines to be useful, the code needs refactoring, not more words
