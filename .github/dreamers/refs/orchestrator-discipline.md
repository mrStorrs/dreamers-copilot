# Orchestrator Discipline (mandatory)

When a Dreamers pipeline sub-skill is doing work the orchestrator handles inline — implementation, test writing, comment writing, logging, git operations — these rules apply.

Cited by `/dreamers-plan`, `/dreamers-implement`, `/dreamers-close-out`, `/dreamers-docs`, `/dreamers-pr`, and the three reviewer agents (Sentinel, Probe, Hone) for the structured findings format spec. `/dreamers-full` does NOT cite this ref directly — it trusts the sub-skills do.

---

## Implementation discipline

- **Plan adherence:** only edit files in the plan's scope (or that the plan's scope clearly entails). No "while I'm here" cleanup, no unrelated refactors mixed with feature work. If a refactor is genuinely needed for the plan's work, do it as a separate inline step and note it in chat.
- **Incremental edits:** make changes in small, coherent steps. Stage with `git add` as work progresses.
- **No spec-arguing comments:** never add a code comment that argues the spec permits a pattern. If a section permits something, cite the exact section number. When in doubt, implement the cleanest separation and let Sentinel judge.
- **All imports at the top of the file.** Every `import` statement before any declaration, function, or expression. Never insert imports mid-file or at the bottom.
- **Method signature changes:** when changing a signature (sync→async, parameter added/removed/renamed), grep the full codebase for every call site before staging. The plan's listed files are necessary but not sufficient.
- **Zustand creator objects:** never use ES getters (they're evaluated once at creation time and baked as static values, never reactive). Define computed values as exported selector functions outside the store.
- **Branch identity check:** before the first edit, run `git log --oneline -3` and confirm the branch and recent commits match the expected feature branch. If the working tree shows no feature commits for this milestone, stop and surface the discrepancy.
- **Data-model changes:** when a plan supersedes an earlier plan's data model, discard the old model completely. Cite the specific interface definitions from the plan's §Data Models (or equivalent) section before writing any new tables or classes.
- **No dependency installs without permission.** Do not add new packages, run `npm install <pkg>`, `pip install <pkg>`, or equivalent without explicit user approval. If a new dependency is needed for the plan, surface it in chat and ask before installing.
- **Type-check before declaring implementation done.** Run the project's type-check command (from project `.github/copilot-instructions.md`). Fix any errors before moving to the test-run step.

## Comment-writing discipline (mandatory — orchestrator is also the implementer)

Pulled from `comment-rules.md`. The orchestrator now writes comments inline, so these rules apply directly to every code edit:

- **No plan/ticket references in source.** Never mention plan files, milestone names (e.g. `D25`, `plan-3`), ticket numbers, agent names, or sub-plan letters in source code (production OR test).
- **No separator comments.** Never use `// ---`, `// ===`, `// ###`, blank-comment lines, or visual dividers.
- **No spec rationalization comments.** Implement cleanly; let review judge.
- **No redundant JSDoc/KDoc** that only repeats the function signature.
- **Style:** one line when possible; never exceed two lines for inline comments. Write *why*, never *what*. If a comment would need more than two lines to be useful, the code needs refactoring, not more words.
- **When to comment:** non-obvious logic (hidden constraints, gotchas, workarounds for specific bugs), public API documentation callers need, TODO/FIXME with specific actionable notes, license headers.

---

## Logging discipline (mandatory — orchestrator writes log calls inline)

Pulled from `logging-standards.md`. Key rules:

- **Log levels (use the right one):**
  - **ERROR** — unhandled or unexpected failures only. Always include the full error object and stack trace. Never swallow silently.
  - **WARN** — recoverable issues, unexpected-but-handled states, deprecations.
  - **INFO** — lifecycle and business signal. Use for startup config (non-secret), shutdown, incoming requests (method/path/status/duration), outbound HTTP (target/endpoint/status/duration), auth events, key business events.
  - **DEBUG** — high-traceability internal flow. Function entry/exit on non-trivial functions, every branch affecting business outcome, repository/data-layer calls (query + row count), cache hits/misses, retry attempts, state-machine transitions, middleware entries/exits.
- **Hard prohibitions — NEVER log:**
  - Passwords, API keys, tokens, secrets of any kind
  - PII: email addresses, phone numbers, names, addresses, payment data
  - Full request or response bodies (log status codes and durations instead)
- **High-frequency loop internals at DEBUG are allowed** if they add traceability value. Mark them with a `// high-freq` comment so Sentinel can assess noise risk.

---

## Test-writing discipline

- **Tests-first:** write failing tests against the plan's Acceptance Criteria and Test Cases (Given/When/Then) BEFORE implementing.
- **AC coverage matrix:** for every plan AC, identify the test(s) that cover it. If an AC has no covering test, write one. Do not declare the cycle done based on test count alone — verify by AC.
- **Layer audit (mandatory after implementation):** for the changed code, ask explicitly per layer:
  - *Unit:* Are there functions, branches, or error paths in the changed code with no unit test?
  - *Integration:* Are there layer boundaries (repo↔DB, service↔API, function↔trigger) exercised by this change without an integration test?
  - *UI / E2E:* Are there user-facing flows, screen states, or navigation paths introduced or changed without a UI / E2E test?
- **Navigation change rule:** when a plan changes how a nav element behaves (tab tap, modal open, screen transition), the work MUST include explicit E2E test cases — not just unit tests.
- **Negative + edge cases:** for non-trivial logic, write tests for invalid input, boundary values, empty/null/max, and error states.
- **No AC labels in test sources:** the AC coverage matrix lives in chat output / the retro. Never label tests with AC numbers, plan refs, or milestone names in source files (no `// AC-3`, no `describe('AC-7: ...')`).
- **No commented-out test bodies:** if a test must be disabled, use the runner's skip mechanism (`it.skip`, `xit`).
- **Test commands:** use ONLY the test commands defined in the project-level `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Do not invent alternatives. Never run tests in parallel unless they are explicitly confirmed safe to run concurrently (separate runtimes, no shared daemon, no shared lock files, no shared output dirs). When in doubt, run sequentially.
- **Final missed-AC check (mandatory, last item of coverage sweep):** After the layer audit, re-read the plan's Acceptance Criteria one final time. Confirm every AC has a green test. If any AC has no covering test and no documented reason, write the test before signaling cycle complete. This is a hard gate.
- **Regression analysis (mandatory when the originating task is a user-reported bug fix):** when the work in this skill was triggered by a user-reported bug, the close-out retro must answer three questions explicitly:
  1. **Why wasn't this caught?** — which test layer failed (no test existed; test existed but didn't cover this path; test covered it but assertion was wrong; test was skipped/deferred)
  2. **What was added?** — specific test(s) now covering this case (names + file paths)
  3. **What else might be missing?** — adjacent cases the same gap might have left uncovered

---

## Closeout / retro discipline

- **Retro file:** `.dreamers/retros/retro-d<N>-<name>.md` per `close-out.md`. Orchestrator writes this inline.
- **Echo-owned section updates** to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (Tech stack, Repo structure, Conventions, Key files, Test commands): delegated to the Echo subagent — see `/dreamers-docs` for the invocation contract.

---

## Git discipline

- Stage with `git add` as work progresses across all phases. Never commit mid-cycle.
- **One commit per cycle** (cohesive plan = one commit total; umbrella = one commit per sub-plan).
- Commit message follows `.github/instructions/git.instructions.md` (if present) or the conventional-commits style used by recent commits on the default branch. Body MUST include `Plan: plan-{slug}` (or `Plan: plan-{slug}-a`).
- **Push exactly once**, immediately before `gh pr create` at final close-out. Never push between sub-plans.

---

## Review phase: parallel reviewers + orchestrator-as-fixer

The review phase in `/dreamers-implement` and `/dreamers-pr-resolve` spawns **three reviewers in parallel** via a single tool-call containing 3 Agent sub-tool-uses:

- **Sentinel** — correctness, security, maintainability lenses
- **Probe** — test coverage lens (AC matrix, layer audit, edge cases, gaps)
- **Hone** — simplicity / over-engineering / architectural quality lens

**All three are read-only / report-only.** They identify findings and return them in the structured format below. **None of them edits files** — the orchestrator (which already has the code in context from implementation) applies fixes from the combined findings.

### Structured findings format (mandatory — all three reviewers MUST use)

Each reviewer returns chat output containing:

**Status line** (one of):
- `Approved — no findings`
- `Findings reported — N items`
- `Blocked — <reason>`

**Findings** (if any) — one bullet per finding, exact format:
```
[severity] [lens-tag] file:line — what was wrong → suggested fix
```

Where:
- `severity` is one of: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`
- `lens-tag` is one of: `correctness`, `security`, `maintainability` (Sentinel) / `test-coverage` (Probe) / `simplicity` (Hone)
- `file:line` is the absolute or repo-relative path + line number
- `what was wrong → suggested fix` is a one-line description + targeted fix the orchestrator can apply mechanically

**Observations** (optional, all reviewers) — out-of-scope notes that aren't findings. The orchestrator may or may not act on them.

**Open questions** (optional, all reviewers) — items needing orchestrator or user judgment. Use "none" if no questions.

### Orchestrator-as-fixer behavior

After all three reviewers return their chat output, the orchestrator:

1. **Concatenates the findings** into a single list, sorted by severity (critical → high → medium → low).
2. **Resolves conflicts.** If two findings touch the same `file:line` with contradicting fixes — e.g., Sentinel `[correctness] add defensive check` vs Hone `[simplicity] remove this as over-engineering` — apply the **conflict-resolution rule**:
   - **Correctness > simplicity always.** When in conflict, the correctness/security/maintainability finding wins.
   - **Genuine ambiguity surfaces to user.** If both arguments are equally strong (rare), present the conflict to the user before applying either.
3. **Applies fixes inline.** The orchestrator has Edit + Write tools; agents don't. Apply each finding's suggested fix as a targeted edit. Stage with `git add`.
4. **Re-runs type-check + tests after applying fixes** (to catch any regression introduced by fix application).
5. **Handles `Blocked` status from any reviewer** by halting the cycle and surfacing the block to the user. Resolve, then re-spawn the affected reviewer.
6. **Handles open questions** from any reviewer by presenting them to the user before declaring the review phase complete.

If the post-fix test run regresses (tests fail), the orchestrator diagnoses and re-fixes inline — up to 3 attempts, then surfaces to the user.

### Parallel spawn — invocation pattern

In the skill body, the review phase is described as a single tool-call with 3 Agent sub-tool-uses (Claude Code idiom) or 3 parallel `task()` invocations (Copilot CLI idiom). Skills should specify intent ("spawn S + P + H in parallel; wait for all three to complete") and let the runtime execute per its primitives. If a runtime doesn't support parallel spawn, the skill still works — wall-clock cost increases but correctness is preserved.
