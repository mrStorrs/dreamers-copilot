# Dreamers Kernel

Universal rules. Inlined at the bottom of every Dreamers skill + agent by `scripts/sync-refs.ps1`.

## Subagent allowlist (HARD RULE)

The only `agent_type` values a skill may pass to `task()`:
- `sentinel`, `probe`, `hone`, `echo`, `sage`

Forbidden: `general-purpose`, `claude`, `claude-code-guide`, `Explore`, `Plan`, `bolt`, or any non-Dreamers agent. Exception: only if the user explicitly authorizes a fallback in the current run.

## Single-owner todo

Each user-invoked skill owns its own todo for its run. When skills compose (e.g., `/dreamers-full` invokes `/dreamers-implement`), the called skill creates its own todo on entry and closes it on exit. Sub-skills do not touch the caller's todo.

## Mandatory subagent prompt line

Every `task()` invocation MUST include this line in the prompt:

```
Do NOT call `manage_todo_list`. The skill that invoked you owns its todo.
```

## Implementation discipline

- **Plan adherence:** edit only files in the plan's scope. No while-I'm-here cleanup, no unrelated refactors mixed with feature work.
- **No spec-arguing comments:** never add a code comment that argues the spec permits a pattern.
- **Branch identity check:** before the first edit, `git log --oneline -3`. Confirm the branch and recent commits match the expected feature. If not, halt and surface.
- **No dependency installs without permission.** Don't run `npm install`, `pip install`, etc. without explicit user approval.
- **Type-check before declaring implementation done.** Run the project's type-check command from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and fix errors before moving on.
